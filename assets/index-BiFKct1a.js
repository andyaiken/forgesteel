Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objects that the heroes must protect from the forces of evil: magic rings, royal birth certificates, dragon eggs, and the like. Heroes often find themselves at violent odds with their enemies as they race to collect a valuable or important item from a guarded temple or castle, or when they need to steal the item from a group of enemies already in possession of it. Objectives in this category work well when paired with other objectives, such as Defeat a Specific Foe. For instance, the heroes must steal a ledger containing a record of criminal activity from an overmind and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain the ledger, the battle won’t be over until they also defeat the overmind, who won’t let the book go without a fight!

### THE THING

The thing the heroes need to get is typically a 1T object. (If the thing is a creature or a bulky object that must be carried past enemies, this might instead be an Escort encounter!) Most or all approach routes to the thing are guarded by enemies, and often a trap or a particularly powerful monster stands guard over the object.

The thing might be fragile (like a document) or virtually unbreakable (like a magic weapon), but in any case, the enemies don’t particularly want to harm it. However, in some cases it can be damaged accidentally.

Additionally, a thing can have one of the following extra defenses:

* **Hidden**: The heroes may need to make one or more successful tests to find the thing, or it may be behind a door or lid that must be opened. It might even be hidden in plain sight. The unassuming sword in an inanimate suit of armor’s hand is really the magic sword they need!
* **Held**: The thing is possessed by an enemy. Perhaps it’s in their pocket or, if the thing is a weapon or implement, the enemy might be using it.`,difficultyModifier:"If there is no powerful monster (at least one-third or more of the encounter’s total EV) or trap directly guarding the thing, the encounter is one step easier. If the thing is hidden or held, the encounter is one stage harder.",successCondition:"The heroes win when all the heroes leave the encounter map with the thing.",failureCondition:"The heroes gain no Victories if the thing is destroyed or remains in the enemies’ hands.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if they leave the map with the thing and the encounter was easy, standard, or hard after being adjusted for this objective. They instead earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter’s difficulty is Extreme or none of the heroes take damage during the encounter."}),re(Mo,"destroyThing",{id:"destroy-thing",name:"Destroy the Thing!",description:`
Combat doesn’t always have to be about destroying your enemies. Sometimes it’s about destroying their stuff! Burning a pirate captain’s vessel, closing a portal to the Abyssal Wasteland before it lets in an army of demons, or shutting down a massive kobold trap made of spinning blades could so hamper the heroes’ foes that the battle is no longer worth fighting once the damage is done.

Sometimes the thing is actually multiple things, all of which must be destroyed.

### THE THING

A typical thing is an object with Stamina equal to the heroes’ level times 20. Most objects have poison and psychic immunity. Additionally, the thing may have immunities or vulnerabilities to one or more damage types, for instance, a magic statue might be immune to fire damage but vulnerable to thunder damage.

Additionally, a thing can have one or more of the following extra defenses:

* **Hidden**: The heroes may need to make one or more successful tests to find the thing, or it may be behind a door or lid that must be opened. It might even be hidden in plain sight.
* **Held**: The thing is possessed by an enemy. A thing can’t be both hidden and held.
* **Sturdy**: The thing’s Stamina is twice what it was.
* **Multiple**: There are multiple things, all of which must be destroyed. Divide the thing’s stamina between all of them.`,difficultyModifier:"If the thing doesn’t have any extra defenses, the encounter is one step easier. If the thing has at least two extra defenses, the encounter is one stage harder.",successCondition:"The heroes win when they destroy the thing.",failureCondition:"The heroes gain no Victories if the thing is not destroyed and remains in the enemies’ hands.",victories:"The heroes gain Victories according to the encounter’s difficulty after being adjusted for this objective. They earn 1 Victory for an easy or standard encounter or 2 for a hard encounter."}),re(Mo,"saveAnother",{id:"save-another",name:"Save Another",description:`
No one earns the mantle of hero without saving a few lives. Sometimes the point of an encounter isn’t to kill, but to save as many folks as you can.

If the heroes rescue powerful allies from the clutches of their foes during combat, the added strength of those allies might be enough to make the remainder of the encounter trivial. When you and your companions save a griffon from a crew of poachers, the hunters become the … well, you know the rest.

### ALLIES AND POTENTIAL ALLIES

Some Save Another encounters feature willing allies (creatures that are able and willing to fight alongside the heroes), and some feature potential allies (creatures that can’t or won’t join the heroes right away—but might later in the battle). In combat, willing allies can be controlled by the heroes (and might use retainer stat blocks), while potential allies are controlled by the Director.

During an encounter, potential allies must be won over and freed from captivity before they become allies. This requires success on a **hard Presence test** made as a maneuver. Potential allies otherwise flee for the nearest exit on their turns.`,difficultyModifier:"For each willing ally the heroes can save who is of their level or higher, add one hero to the party for the purposes of building your encounter.",successCondition:"Once all allies are freed and have either joined the fight or retreated off the encounter map, and at least half of the allies lived through the encounter, the heroes win.",failureCondition:"The heroes gain no Victories if half or more of the allies are dead or captured.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if the success condition was met and encounter was easy or standard after being adjusted by the objective’s difficulty modifier. The heroes gain 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the combat encounter was hard or extreme or all of the allies were saved and survived."}),re(Mo,"escort",{id:"escort",name:"Escort",description:`
Surprising as it may seem, sometimes the fate of the mission doesn’t rest on the heroes’ shoulders at all! Sometimes it rests on the shoulders of someone standing next to the heroes. The heroes’ job is to keep this important person safe as they travel to a specific destination.

Not every Escort encounter is on behalf of a wise or mighty ally. Sometimes the heroes are tasked with protecting a helpless or even an actively troublesome creature, such as a hapless noble or a wayward child. They might even have to protect a bulky or inconvenient inanimate object. Whatever the case, the enemies just keep coming until the heroes get their charge to their destination.

### WARD

The creature or object to be protected is called the ward. At the start of each round, choose a hero. The ward moves on that hero’s turn and is controlled by that hero. Most wards can take a move action or a maneuver on their turn, but not both. A ward’s characteristics and speed are determined by the Director. Most humanoid wards have a speed of 5.

A sturdy ward, such as an able-bodied citizen, typically has Stamina equal to 10 times the heroes’ level. A delicate ward, such as an elderly diplomat or an important object, typically has Stamina equal to 5 times the heroes’ level.

### DESTINATION

Every Escort encounter has a destination: a place of safety beyond which the enemies won’t follow.

Typically, when the encounter begins, the ward’s distance from the destination is at least three times the ward’s Speed (though they can start closer if difficult terrain or other obstacles complicate the route). The heroes’ enemies can be placed anywhere on the encounter map, including between the ward and the destination, but not within 5 squares of the destination.

### REINFORCEMENTS

At the start of each round, any minion that was killed during the last round is replaced by a reinforcement. The Director chooses their position, which can’t be within 5 squares of the ward, the destination, or any hero.`,difficultyModifier:"A combat encounter’s difficulty is one stage harder with a delicate ward.",successCondition:"The heroes win when the ward reaches their destination.",failureCondition:"If the ward is reduced to 0 Stamina or is prevented from reaching their destination, the heroes gain no Victories.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if the success condition is met. They earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the combat encounter’s difficulty is extreme after being adjusted for this objective or the ward and all heroes reach their destination in fewer than 3 rounds."}),re(Mo,"holdThemOff",{id:"hold-them-off",name:"Hold Them Off",description:`
Sometimes the heroes just need to buy time. They might need to battle a conquering tyrant’s army to allow innocent villagers time to escape. They might need to hold off wave after wave of zombies while a group of priests completes a ritual to lay the undead to rest for good. To achieve this objective, the heroes need to stay alive and protect a particular position for a number of rounds determined by the Director.

### DEFENSIVE POSITION

The Director (or the heroes) choose a defensive position, an area that must be held and controlled by the heroes. The fewer of the heroes’ enemies that get passed the defensive position, the better their chances of success. The area can be any size. The defensive position blocks entry to a vulnerable area the heroes are defending.

Often, a defensive position grants bonuses to its defenders. The approach to the position might be narrow, over difficult terrain, or require climbing, or anyone inside the position might have the benefit of higher ground against anyone outside it.

### ENCOUNTER DURATION

The Director determines the encounter duration, the number of rounds that the heroes must defend the area in order to be successful. A typical encounter duration is 3 rounds.

### REINFORCEMENTS

At the end of each round, the Director adds more enemies for the heroes to battle on the map. The new group should have an EV of all the enemies killed during that round plus the EV value of one hero. If the Director doesn’t spend all of their EV in a round, the remainder can be added to a future round.

Reinforcements appear at least 10 squares from the defensive position.`,difficultyModifier:"A Hold Them Off encounter’s difficulty is determined by the creatures present for the battle at the beginning of the first round of combat. Don’t count reinforcements toward the difficulty. The encounter difficulty is one step harder if the encounter duration is 5 rounds or greater.",successCondition:"The heroes win if they survive for the encounter duration and let fewer creatures through the defensive position than there are heroes.",failureCondition:"The heroes earn now Victories if a number of creatures equal to or greater than their number get passed the defensive position.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if the success condition is met. They earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the combat encounter’s difficulty is extreme or the heroes hold off the enemy for an encounter duration of 5 rounds or more."}),re(Mo,"assaultDefenses",{id:"assault-defenses",name:"Assault the Defenses",description:`
The enemy holds a strategically important position and the heroes want it. In a reverse of the Hold Them Off encounter, the heroes seize the enemy’s defensive position. The encounter ends when the heroes secure this spot for themselves. Those enemies likely know better than to assault that position on a whim, because they just held it!

Sometimes, and Assault the Defenses encounter is part of a combined objective. First you’ve got to assault the defenses, then you’ve got to hold off against counterattack.

### DEFENSIVE POSITION

The Director choose a defensive position, an area that must be captured by the heroes. The area can be any size. Not all of the heroes’ enemies in the encounter are in this position, as some are outside attempting to stop heroes before they get close.

Often, a defensive position grants bonuses to its defenders. The approach to the position might be narrow, over difficult terrain, or require climbing, or anyone inside the position might have the benefit of higher ground against anyone outside it.`,difficultyModifier:"An Assault the Defenses encounter’s difficulty is one stage harder if the defensive position grants two or more bonuses to its defenders.",successCondition:"The heroes win when at least one hero and none of their enemies have been in the defensive position for four consecutive turns.",failureCondition:"The heroes only fail if they are unable to achieve the success condition.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if the success condition is met, or 2 Victories if the success condition is met and encounter’s difficulty is hard or extreme after being adjusted by the objective."}),re(Mo,"stopAction",{id:"stop-action",name:"Stop the Action",description:`
Sometimes combat is complicated by the fact that the heroes need to stop the villainous actions of their foes. It’s not enough to simply defeat the warriors in a cult. The heroes must also stop the zealots’ archdevil-summoning ritual! Or it might be that the heroes need to interrupt a wedding and make sure an evil mage doesn’t marry the heir to the throne. Despite combat, the mage forces the ceremony to continue! Objectives in this category often have a timer associated with them. If the heroes don’t achieve the objective in a certain number of rounds, the conditions of the battle often change. For instance, if the cultists summon the archdevil, defeating the devil suddenly becomes the heroes’ new objective!

### ENCOUNTER DURATION

The Director determines the encounter duration, the number of rounds before the villains complete their plans. A typical encounter duration is 3 rounds. Sometimes, events can change the encounter duration Succeeding on a hard Reason test to dispute the wedding’s legality increases the encounter duration by 1, or allowing zealots to sacrifice an innocent creature as part of their ritual decreases it by 1.

### STOPPING THE ACTION

The villain’s evil plan has certain requirements, and if those requirements aren’t met, the action is stopped and the heroes are victorious. For instance, to complete a ritual, during each round at least one zealot priest might be required to spend an action to further the ritual. A wedding can’t be completed if a participant or the officiant is killed or captured.

### FAILURE CONSEQUENCES

If the villains’ plan succeeds, there may be additional consequences within the encounter. For instance, if the zealots summon a demon, or if a newly-crowned evil mage uses their new royal authority to summon guards, the heroes may face extra enemies. These potential reinforcements aren’t counted towards the encounter’s difficulty, since they only appear once the heroes have failed the encounter. This is an entirely new battle now!`,difficultyModifier:"A Stop the Action encounter’s difficulty is one step harder if the encounter duration is 2 or less, and one Step easier if the action can be stopped by killing or removing any single creature.",successCondition:"The heroes win if they stop the action before the encounter duration is up.",failureCondition:"The heroes gain no Victories if they fail to stop the action before the end of the encounter duration. The heroes may earn Victories from any new encounters that occur because of a failure consequence.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if the success condition is met, or 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the combat encounter’s difficulty is extreme or the heroes stop the action before the last round of the encounter duration."}),re(Mo,"completeAction",{id:"complete-action",name:"Complete the Action",description:`
The opposite of a Stop the Action encounter, this objective ending sees the characters charged with initiating an event, performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance, if the heroes are attempting to launch an airship while repelling a time raider boarding party, the encounter could be over the moment the heroes manage to activate the vessel and take off with just a few time raiders actually aboard.

### ENCOUNTER DURATION

The Director determines the encounter duration, the number of rounds before the heroes can complete their plans. A typical encounter duration is 3 rounds.

### TASKS AND FAILURES

During each round, at least half the heroes must spend a maneuver performing a task that advances their plans. Each round, the Director decides what tasks are available and where they must be performed. For instance, to launch an airship, one hero might have to cast off an anchor on deck while another unfurls a sail at the top of a mast. The list of available tasks may change each turn.

If at the end of a round the heroes have failed to perform the required number of tasks, the party accumulates one failure.

For more difficult encounters, performing a task may require a successful test.`,difficultyModifier:"A Complete the Action encounter’s difficulty is one step harder if the encounter duration is 5 or more, or if completing tasks requires a successful test. It is one step easier if the encounter duration is 2 or less.",successCondition:"The heroes win if they reach the end of the encounter duration with 1 or 0 failures.",failureCondition:"The heroes gain no Victories and the can’t complete the action if they accumulate 2 or more failures during the encounter duration.",victories:"The heroes gain 1 Victory if the success condition is met or 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the combat encounter’s difficulty is extreme after being modified by this objective or the heroes reach the end of the encounter duration with zero failures."});var

Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain in this class before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.

You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T rodent who fits the animal type. When you take on animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls unharmed to the ground, as you decide. When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can’t enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. If you are dying, you revert to your true form and can’t turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (anggwaLAHtulls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces only accessible by water. They are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to an angulotl clutch without realizing it. Though angulotls prefer to avoid combat, when they’re threatened or pressed, they turn deadly.`,information:[{id:"angulotl-info-1",name:"Deadly Toxins",description:"Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression—they don’t need to be!

While toxins don’t kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path—even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most … and sometimes gives them strange abilities."},{id:"angulotl-info-3",name:"Moisture Dependent",description:"Angulotls breathe through their skin, but they need to stay damp or they suffocate.

Demons spawn in the Abyssal Wasteland, where evil and chaos meet. These creatures of incarnate evil crave violence and suffering in the way most other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear apart lesser demons for fun. 

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a human arm growing from their forehead.`,information:[{id:"demon-info-1",name:"Mortal Alliances",description:"Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon."},{id:"demon-info-2",name:"Soul Reavers",description:"Demons feast not on food or water, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while starved for souls, a demon can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature with a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities."},{id:"demon-info-3",name:"Demonic Hierarchy",description:`
Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, and the higher a demon’s category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don’t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. 

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there’s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt—or heroic.

The following demons have been identified across categories 1-3:
• **Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects, but possess gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.

• **Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting ahold of an unfortunate soul. The pitling is in the process of digesting the soul of a creature, physically boring through its head, and flopping around like an appendage. The body is puppeteered and mid transformation into a demon, with mouths forming on the creature’s hands and arms that shoot out long, barbed tongues as attacks. 

• **Frenzied** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced, resulting in a fast and viscous creature full of energy and hunger for more souls. 

• Rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash, **remasches** are demons whose physical form is blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control.  

• Possessed of glowing eyes and tendril-ringed maws, **ruinants** breathe with a sickening wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon’s own body. 

• **Torlases** are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don’t obey the normal laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position. 

• **Bendraks** appear as an amalgamation of flesh and shards of a broken mirror, able to shape their bodies to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy’s attack to another enemy or hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections. 

• **Mucerons** are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature, covered in several mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, pulling an enemy’s attention along with pulling them physically.  

• **Chorogaunts** are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile, living musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon’s chest and its ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.`},{id:"demon-info-4",name:"Demon Languages",description:"Demons speak Proto-Ctholl"}],malice:[r.feature.createMalice({id:"demon-malice-1",name:"Soulburn",cost:3,sections:["Each demon acting this turn has a double edge on their abilities."]}),r.feature.createMalice({id:"demon-malice-2",name:"Abyssal Rift",cost:5,sections:["Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choosing.

Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief, born from failure in the pursuit of perfection. A dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate.

These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on fastidiously they are about cleaning, and occasionally gilded with more precious metals. When threatened, they can encase themselves in shields they have embedded subcutaneously beneath their scales. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.`,information:[{id:"dragon-crucible-info-1",name:"Bastions of Steel",description:`
Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in those cut with thick veins of iron. Occasionally they will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle the first thing in place is their colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, expressing their dragonseal by slagging it in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but they keep a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers. 

Eventually their entire lair is coated with hardened metal and discarded weapons, armor, and shields. This makes the lair of any crucible dragon hazardous to navigate, and extremely conductive of electricity.`},{id:"dragon-crucible-info-2",name:"Discerning Collectors",description:`
The dragons tend to be obsessive collectors. They have a habit of hyper focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, The Rain of 10,000 Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Valsoria. Joris’nyrathi, The Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge.

Obsession aside, crucible dragons do manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than melting them down for filigree and embossment on the weapons and armor they forge. Adventurers plundering a crucible dragon’s hoard may not find much wealth but will usually find enough materials and armaments to supply several wars simultaneously.`},{id:"dragon-crucible-info-3",name:"Flawed Pursuits",description:"The failure that spawned the crucible dragon drives their obsessive pursuits. They will endlessly attempt to reproduce the perfect treasures they find among their most prized possessions but can only recreate flawed copies at a fraction of their original power. Discarded projects, melted heaps of raw iron, and scrap angrily embedded in the walls perpetually surround crucible dragons as examples of their failures, perpetuating a cycle of obsessive rage, grief, and inescapable decline."},{id:"dragon-crucible-info-4",name:"Hammers in Search of Nails",description:`
There is nothing a crucible dragon hates more than creativity, beauty, and exquisite craft. When raiding with a particular object in mind, they are not acute in how they make their entrance. Collateral damage is part of the equation and the message. Along with whatever they take, they’ll endeavor to destroy any great works of art, beautiful architecture, and slay craftspeople and artists who are considered the pinnacle of their craft within the immediate proximity.

The most notorious of these attacks was made by Nuvithiabalca the Hammer of the Spiteforge, who destroyed a dwarven Forgetemple at its grand opening.

Gloom dragons are eerie collectors of voices, memories, nightmares, and items.

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarven flesh is infused with stone - a silico-organic hybrid making them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

They are the children of the elder god Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is “Ord made the world.” Their way of saying, “What will be, will be.” Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord’s name.`,information:[{id:"dwarf-info-1",name:"Tools of the Trade",description:`
Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the Steel Dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power.

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it's a double headed hammer. As much as they use it for destruction, construction is where they truly shine. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools created to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.`},{id:"dwarf-info-2",name:"Innovative Operation",description:`
The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, their ancestors’ greatest achievement, but they’ve made great strides in researching them. They’ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator.

Operators now span the manifold and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for utility and construction purposes but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises.

Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where smiths, artisans, and craftspeople from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.`},{id:"dwarf-info-3",name:"The Press Gangs of Kas Kalavar",description:`

When the gods formed the Mundane World, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the universe’s most basic elements—air, fire, earth, and water. Some elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.`,information:[{id:"elemental-info-1",name:"Duality of Form",description:`
Elementals are mercurial creatures of transformation, creation, and destruction. Though the deities first created the Mundane World, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn’t suit an elemental, they break it down with fire, wind, or another element, then build it anew. 

Elementals themselves also change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.`},{id:"elemental-info-2",name:"Rebirth and Reformation",description:"When an elemental dies in the Mundane World, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain strength.

The crux of fire, often called a *blazecaster*, takes the form of a fiery lizard. They often live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity.

At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, or *galeweaver*, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon.

An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of *tidedrifter*. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against regulars who sail or swim in their waters.

The adage “knowledge is power” is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation might be, “knowledge before power.” High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy.

In their ruined towers they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill without lifting more than a few fingers.`},{id:"elf-high-info-3",name:"Elemental Summoners",description:`
Through their studies of ancient magic, the high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elementals and can call upon their aid where they need it. Soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances. 

Most high elves have also learned to summon magical wisps called elemental motes.

The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells further, sometimes miles away from the caster with an entire platoon working in unison.

When the shadow elves were exiled from Equinox, many left on ancient beasts known as brush stalkers, quadrupedal beasts that carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers.

A brush stalker’s glamor allows it to look just like a normal deer. But when the glamour is off, the creature devours the light around it and plunges its surroundings into darkness.`},{id:"elf-shadow-info-4",name:"Fractured Factions",description:`
Almost immediately upon arrival in The World Below, the shadow elves developed wildly different ideas for what to do about it. Some want desperately to return, while others seek to assimilate into their new home. As generations come and go, and memories of Equinox are lost to time, the shadow elves who have not yet carved a new place for themselves grow anxious. 

One particularly fanatical sect has made it to Orden and mold the manifold in Equinox’s image. They believe their home is lost to them forever, and their only recourse is to blot out Orden’s sun and make a new one. `},{id:"elf-shadow-info-5",name:"Dusk Calling",description:`
Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen cosmos by which they are lit. With this link, a warrior can perform the Call: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. This can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the Caller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage. 

A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group Call, which is powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step towards terraforming a second Equinox. `},{id:"elf-shadow-info-6",name:"Shadow Tactics",description:`
Since shadow elves have no permanent home, their military strength typically emphasizes both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they cannot benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, create them. If the light is too bright, remove it.  

In many shadow elf societies, all people are given at least basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children’s game hide and seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.`},{id:"elf-shadow-info-7",name:"Shadow Elf Languages",description:"Most shadow elves speak Variac and Illyvric, though platoon leaders may speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.

Children of the Sylvan Celestials, masters of the elf-haunted forests called wodes, these elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans as snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans should fear the trees.

Their natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, compliments their guerilla style of fighting, striking quickly from cover and then melding back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few who dwell in human cities naturally adept at urban warfare.`,information:[{id:"elf-wode-info-1",name:"Heart of the Wode",description:"The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are more receptive to strangers who respect the land they trespass upon. Those who harm it, however, ruin their one and only chance of treating peacefully with the wode’s beating heart."},{id:"elf-wode-info-2",name:"Wodeworking",description:`
Wode elves know a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal and to create magical constructs that act as servitor creatures, including their mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg’s rider is typically also their singer, creating a connection between the two that can last a lifetime.

Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, that were sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. They outlived their creators and roam the world as unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.`},{id:"elf-wode-info-3",name:"Sylvan Surveillance",description:`
The wode elves’ natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest’s goings-on while inside of it. This isn’t some telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of an amateur campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf’s understanding of their surroundings.

A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does the trees.`},{id:"elf-wode-info-4",name:"Blightless Ambition",description:"Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers. Some groups view even the very presence of humans as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of scavenging parties, known as the Blightless, searches the forest for lost mortals. They seek to eliminate these threats by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless seek to expand the boundaries of their home, attacking civilizations that exist close to the forest’s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of a mostly peaceful people."},{id:"elf-wode-info-5",name:"Chirugeons",description:"When wode elves control the terrain, one of their primary strategies is divide and conquer.

The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician.

The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life.

The first gnolls arose when a pack of these predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As’sylrak the Warper. 

As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends “gnoll,” an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is “to consume completely.” And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.`},{id:"gnoll-info-2",name:"Ceaseless Hunger",description:"The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger.

As with all humanoid ancestries, different types of goblins and goblin cultures can be found across many lands, each with their own ideals. Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning “more of us” in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and in places many other humanoids avoid, including deep cave systems.

Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society - thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.`,information:[{id:"goblin-info-1",name:"Encountered in Groups",description:"Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident - perhaps overly so.

Larger bands might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains.

Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by griffon beak or talon.

They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can’t fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly—and after that, it’s only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby."},{id:"griffon-info-3",name:"Rare Breeds",description:"Griffons come in many varieties.

Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more by the sword. Others turn to theft, often driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons—both exact a toll.

Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek dark desires in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.

Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.`},{id:"human-info-2",name:"Risks and Rewards",description:`
Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive training explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment—knowing when to risk it all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent’s mistakes and seize the advantage.

Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosper-ous village or an ancient dungeon yielding a chest full of coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it’s a game worth playing.`},{id:"human-info-3",name:"Swords for Hire",description:"With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands.

Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry centurion, they pose a significant threat.",information:[{id:"kobold-info-1",name:"Defensive Masters",description:`
In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary; every warrior carries a shield into battle, and soldiers defend each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold’s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.

Kobold legionaries may join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.`},{id:"kobold-info-2",name:"Unconventional Tactics",description:"Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn’t take them seriously. Their foes haven’t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy mechanical dragons and flaming spike pit traps."},{id:"kobold-info-3",name:"Tiny Dragons",description:"Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons - and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales; as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon’s scales over several generations."},{id:"kobold-info-4",name:"Domain Expansion",description:"When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they become more like that dragon in more than just color. Some groups worship the dragon like a god. Others revere them as a leader or ancestor, or admire them like a really (REALLY) big brother. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon’s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of that domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, may rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and may end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living inside a domain do influence the size and strength of the dragon’s hold on the territory."},{id:"kobold-info-5",name:"Kobold and Dragon Symbiosis",description:"Most dragons are solitary creatures, but kobolds living in their domain provide both parties with clear benefits. A dragon can establish their domain over an area in half the time if they allow kobolds to settle in the area as well. Meanwhile, a kobold that spends 1 week or more living within the domain of a dragon becomes immune to the hazardous and negative effects of that domain. The kobold’s physical appearance may also change the longer they stay in the area."},{id:"kobold-info-6",name:"Terrain Mastery",description:"All of this – the kobolds’ innovative spirit, affinity for their terrain, group defenses, and creative tactics – makes a kobold legion the master of the area in which they live. While they employ traps and tricks of their own creations, they also know the ins and outs of nature’s traps. For example, a sagittarius might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over a frozen lake or desert sands, don’t give chase; they likely know something about these terrain hazards that you do not."},{id:"kobold-info-7",name:"Kobold Languages",description:"Most goblins speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian."}],malice:[r.feature.createMalice({id:"kobold-malice-1",name:"Maniple Tactics",cost:3,sections:["Up to 3 kobolds make a free strike, swaps positions with an adjacent kobold, and then that kobold makes a free strike."]}),r.feature.createMalice({id:"kobold-malice-2",name:"Set the Initiative",cost:5,sections:["Two kobolds take their turns in a row."]}),r.feature.createMalice({id:"kobold-malice-3",name:"Shield Wall",cost:7,sections:["Until the end of the round, all kobolds with Shield?

In a long-lost language, the word oruk—“blood fire”—described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin in their own tongue, they also use “orc” with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.

Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They’ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.

Though orcs are no more likely to stand in the adventurers’ way than any other folk, those who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.`,information:[{id:"orc-info-1",name:"Relentlessly Tough",description:`
Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they’re excited or driven. Their hair, which can range from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with “blood fire,” glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white respectively.`},{id:"orc-info-2",name:"Innate Power",description:"Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These Bloodfire Burn skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies’ knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree."},{id:"orc-info-3",name:"Orc Magic",description:"The intense power of an orc’s spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc dynamos hone their magic into singular affinities that are easy to manipulate. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature’s spirit."},{id:"orc-info-4",name:"Mohlers",description:`
Mohlers are spined, pig-like beasts that corkscrew through the ground faster than they can run. Originating from deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests—and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield and knock the orcs’ enemies off their feet. 

When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.`},{id:"orc-info-5",name:"Scyza",description:`
Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. Orcs adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride the scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. 

The scyza’s trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.`},{id:"orc-info-6",name:"Orc Languages",description:"Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak."}],malice:[r.feature.createMalice({id:"orc-malice-1",name:"Overwhelming March",cost:3,sections:["Each orc shifts up to their speed, moving through enemy squares if they can.

Small, agile, and hardy, radenwights have the appearance of humanoid rodents. They’re often referred to as “ratfolk,” a name they don’t particularly mind but also don’t embrace. Should anyone ask, many radenwights speak of being a ratfolk when they’re alone, but always a radenwight when part of a group. Radenwight groups proudly call themselves a “meddle,” and have a knack for appearing where others hoped they wouldn’t or whenever they are least expected. Radenwight meddles can be found in the wilderness as easily as in any city, so long as there’s suitable work and excitement to keep the members of the meddle occupied.

If radenwights’ enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they will be painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever radenwights do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren’t above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.`,information:[{id:"radenwight-info-1",name:"Bonds and Bravado",description:"It’s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety only gets you so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community, and the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it’s not one radenwight’s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows."},{id:"radenwight-info-2",name:"The Magic of Music",description:"The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist who enraptured an evil dragon while her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped from the cliff above."},{id:"radenwight-info-3",name:"The Great Maclette",description:`
The name Maclette is never uttered without The Great before it. The radenwight maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies that always seem to be one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.

In truth, The Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he’ll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great masterpiece.`},{id:"radenwight-info-4",name:"Radenwight Languages",description:"Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch."}],malice:[r.feature.createAbility({ability:r.createAbility({id:"radenwight-malice-1",name:"Trouser Cut",type:r.type.createAction({qualifiers:["Non-minion"]}),cost:3,keywords:[f.Melee,f.Strike,f.Weapon],distance:[r.distance.createMelee()],target:"One creature",powerRoll:r.createPowerRoll({bonus:2,tier1:"7 damage; push 3",tier2:"10 damage; push 3; taunted (EoT)",tier3:"13 damage; push 5; taunted (EoT)"}),effect:"If a target is wearing clothing covering the lower half of their body, they must use a maneuver to pull that clothing up before they can move."})}),r.feature.createMalice({id:"radenwight-malice-2",name:"Rat Race",cost:5,sections:["Each radenwight shifts up to their speed.

The lush ground squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. By the time you realize the ground is moving, it’s too late— the shambling mound has devoured you.

Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.`,information:[{id:"shambling-mound-info-1",name:"Noxious Origins",description:`
A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of nearby hags or mages, especially evil ones or those utilizing green magic. Latent magic seeps into the surrounding land, coalescing into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must grow, and to grow they must feed—and thus they drag themself in search of a hunting ground.

It is believed these magical origins are what give shambling mounds their ability to produce poisons. These poisons range from region to region—for example, the toxins from a shambling mound along coastal beaches or swamps might appear milky white and smell sweet like manchineel trees, while shambling mounds found in rainforests might give off a heady, intoxicating sweet scent at night, luring victims in with beautiful pale blooms like angel’s trumpets and producing intense hallucinations for those unfortunate enough to become poisoned.

While more specific effects may vary, each shambling mound’s toxins typically have the same aim: enervate their foes, so that they might magically absorb that strength and vitality.`},{id:"shambling-mound-info-2",name:"Hearty Eaters",description:"As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass.

This vegetative hunter can then sap the strength of those within to feast or empower itself."},{id:"shambling-mound-info-3",name:"Verdant Core and Expansive Sprawl",description:`
When fighting a shambling mound, most attention is drawn to the cavernous chamber that holds their consumed victims. However, the shambling mound protects a smaller magical core with a knot of vines, leaves, and other natural defenses. The mound can expose this core to free up their form and become deadlier, thus opening themselves up, in turn, for more harm.

Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something other than a mortal. No matter the reason for their creation, all undead were once living creatures who walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order. 

Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people’s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.`,information:[{id:"undead-info-1",name:"Dark Places",description:"For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While it is rarely harmful to them, the sun’s golden rays make them uncomfortable and seems to shine far too bright to their dead eyes.

Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims."},{id:"undead-info-2",name:"Encountered Together",description:"Undead creatures are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and wights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don’t need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations."},{id:"undead-info-3",name:"Corporeal Undead",description:`
At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, wights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Most lack a soul, and many can’t think beyond the orders of their creators (unlike more powerful corporeal undead, such as liches and vampires). Those who aren’t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things. 

The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. These spells also halt decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration when magic touched them. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, there are tales of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astrological occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.`},{id:"undead-info-4",name:"Incorporeal ndead",description:`
Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be formed by a person’s vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer’s dark art. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, spectral undead are malice incarnate. 

Spectral undead who naturally formed from the souls of malicious, hate-filled humanoids usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being serve their creator.

Vampirism is a curse of blood. A curse that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life’s essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.

Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their mortal forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire’s power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master’s orders.

Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect.

Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then they burst into violence.

Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked Strategoi. Each Strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is usually selected for their ability to think and plan. The Strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the Legion to their Inner Council.

Below the Inner Council are the hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well-considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. Therefore, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer, war dogs turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable of only following their final orders.

War dogs have a heavy focus on minion frontlines backed by captains with powerful control or support abilities. Their tactics reflect the replaceability of their low-ranking troops, throwing them into the mix without caution. Once a squad of minions is reduced to a few stragglers, captains will order them into position for maximum effect and manually detonate their loyalty collars.

The captains are intelligent, well-trained, and capable of prioritizing threats to their mission. Defensive and support units focus on tying up and slowing down high-Stamina threats while offensive units try their best to bully low-Stamina backline heroes. Unless ordered, retreat is not an option.

Few dragons can match the fury of a wyvern. Their aggression is driven by hunting and territorial instinct. Many adventurers meet their end in the wyvern’s maw—some because the wyvern saw them as competitors, and others because the wyvern was simply hungry.

Xorannox (ZOR-ah-nocks) rules as Lord of the White Tower, a multi-level finger of alabaster stone. Commonly known as the Tyract – an ancient Za’hariax word that literally translates as “a king who rules with his teeth” – the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.

Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the voiceless talkers’ great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god. 

The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he’s delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.

Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies.

**Awe**: When you begin this project, choose either Charming or Threatening. If you choose Charming, you gain an edge on Presence tests to win people other creatures over or make a good impression. If you choose Threatening, you gain an edge on Presence tests made to intimidate, coerce, or bully.

**Damage Immunity I**: When you begin this project, select three damage types. You have immunity 5 to those damage types.

**Disguise**: You can use a maneuver to cause this armor to appear as any type of clothing that you have been in the presence of - a noble’s dress, a guard’s uniform, a cultist’s robes, and so forth. The armor loses none of its protective qualities while transformed into other clothing.

**Iridescent**: When you are the sole target of an ability, you can use a free triggered action to reveal that the ability was targeting an afterimage of you in the same space as you. The power roll for the ability is treated as an 11. You can’t use this enhancement again until you earn a Victory.

**Magic Resistance I**: Your characteristic scores are considered 1 higher (to a maximum of 2) for the purpose of resisting the potencies of magic abilities.

**Nettlebloom**: Whenever you are grabbed by a creature adjacent to you, your armor sprouts toxic nettles. While an adjacent creature has you grabbed, they are weakened.

**Phasing I**: Once per turn, you can move through 1 square of solid matter. If you end your turn inside solid matter, you take 5 damage, which can’t be reduced in any way, and are shunted out into the space from which you entered it.

**Psionic Resistance I**: Your characteristic scores are considered 1 higher (to a maximum of 2) for the purpose of resisting the potencies of psionic abilities.

**Swift**: Your speed increases by 1.

**Tempest I**: As a maneuver, you can infuse this armor with the essence of a storm. The first time an adjacent creature makes deals damage to you before the end of your next turn, they take lightning damage equal to your highest characteristic score and you can push them 1 square.`})),re(oi,"imbueImplement",r.createProject({id:"project-imbue-implement",name:"Imbue Implement",prerequisites:"Varies",source:"Texts or lore in a language determined by the enhancement",characteristic:[N.Agility,N.Reason,N.Intuition],goal:150,effect:`
Implements are jewelry, orbs, staffs, tomes, wands, weapons, and other objects used by magic and psionic users to focus their power. You decide what object to imbue when you create an implement treasure, but it must be an object you can carry or wear. You must have a mundane version of the item you plan to imbue when you begin this project. An implement imbued with an enhancement grants you special benefits while it is wielded. Additionally, when an implement receives its 1st- level enhancement, it grants a +1 rolled damage bonus for your damage-dealing magic and psionic abilities.

**Berserking**: Whenever you damage a creature using a supernatural ability and obtain a tier 3 result on the power roll, that creature must make an opportunity attack against their nearest ally (if possible) after the ability’s effects resolve. This strike deals extra damage equal to the highest of your Reason, Intuition, or Presence scores.

**Displacing I**: Whenever you damage a creature using a supernatural ability and obtain a tier 3 result on the power roll, you can teleport that creature up to 2 squares after the ability’s effects resolve. If the creature started on a horizontal surface, they must end on a horizontal surface.

**Elemental**: Whenever you use an ability with the Air, Earth, Fire, Green, Rot, Void, or Water keyword, you can attune this implement to that element until the end of the encounter. While the implement is attuned, you gain an edge on power rolls with that elemental keyword. The implement can be attuned to only one element at a time.

**Forceful I**: Whenever you use a supernatural ability to push or pull a creature, you can move that creature an additional 2 squares.

**Rat Form**: As a maneuver, you can transform into a rat. Your equipment transforms with you. As a rat, you have a speed of 5 with the Climb keyword, your size is 1T, and you can see in the dark. You can speak and keep your skills while in rat form, but your Might becomes −5 and you lose all your regular abilities, features, and benefits. You can revert to your natural form as a maneuver, and do so automatically if you take any damage.

**Rejuvenating I**: Whenever you use an ability that costs 1 or more Heroic Resources, roll a d10. On a 9 or higher, you gain 1 Heroic Resource.

**Seeking**: Your ranged magic and psionic abilities gain a +2 distance bonus. Additionally, if you speak the name of a specific person, place, or object to the implement, the implement points toward that target, provided you are on the same world.

**Thought Sending**: Your ranged magic and psionic abilities gain a +2 distance bonus. Additionally, you can telepathically speak with any willing creature who knows a language and whose name you know, provided they are on the same world as you. You must initiate the conversation, but once you do, the creature can respond until you end the conversation.

**Warding I**: You gain a +6 Stamina bonus.

**Blood Bargain**: As a maneuver, you can harm yourself with the weapon, taking 1d6 damage that can’t be reduced in any way. An ally within 5 squares can then spend a Recovery.

**Chilling I**: Whenever you damage a creature using this weapon and obtain a tier 3 result on the power roll, that creature takes 3 cold damage.

**Disrupting I**: Whenever you damage an undead using this weapon and leave that undead with 15 Stamina or less, they drop to 0 Stamina.

**Hungering I**: Whenever you damage a creature other than yourself using this weapon, you regain Stamina based on the tier result of the power roll - 3 Stamina for tier 1, 5 for tier 2, and 8 for tier 3. You can’t regain this Stamina if you’re dying.

**Hurling**: Whenever you use an ability with a melee distance using this weapon, you can throw the weapon by treating the ability’s distance as Ranged 3 instead. When the ability is resolved, the weapon returns to your hand. Any ability used when you throw this weapon can’t impose the grabbed or restrained conditions.

**Merciful**: Whenever you reduce a non-undead to 0 Stamina using this weapon, the creature falls unconscious and wakes up 1d6 hours later. A creature with the Heal skill can wake the unconscious creature early with 1 minute of medical treatment. Whenever the creature wakes, they regain 1 Stamina.

**Terrifying I**: Whenever you damage a creature using this weapon and obtain a tier 3 result on the power roll, that creature takes 3 psychic damage.

**Thundering I**: Whenever you damage a creature using this weapon, you can push that creature up to 2 squares after the other effects of the ability resolve.

**Vengeance I**: Whenever you use this weapon with an ability against a creature who has dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn, you gain a +2 damage bonus on the ability.

**Wingbane**: Whenever you damage a flying creature using this weapon, that creature is also bleeding (save ends). While bleeding in this way, the creature takes 1 damage per square they fly. If the creature starts and ends their turn on the same solid surface, the bleeding condition ends.`})),re(oi,"discoverLore",r.createProject({id:"project-discover-lore",name:"Discover Lore",source:"Texts or knowledge related to the subject you wish to research",characteristic:[N.Reason],effect:`
If you want to track the location of a lost treasure, decipher a ritual, or trace the lineage of a royal family to find the next heir to the throne, you can start a project to delve into whatever mysteries you seek to unravel. You might start a project to discover lore because the information can’t be discovered through a regular test, or you could do so because you failed a test to recall information and now want to learn it through research.

When you start a project to discover lore, you choose the lore you want investigated and the questions you want answered. The Director tells you if the lore you seek amounts to common, obscure, lost, or forbidden knowledge. The more esoteric the knowledge, the more project points are required to find the answers you seek.

When you begin a Discover Lore project, other creatures can also work on the project, using their respite activity to contribute a project roll to it in order to get the work done faster.

| Project             | Goal |
|:--------------------|:-----|
| Common knowledge    | 15   |
| Obscure knowledge   | 45   |
| Lost knowledge      | 120  |
| Forbidden knowledge | 240  |

**Common Knowledge**: Common knowledge is generally easy to discover with a day or so of research. It’s not known by every passerby and takes time to uncover, but with plentiful local sources for the information, you don’t need to spend a lot of time searching. It could be that you need to question several members of a rumor mill to figure out who a noble is not-so-secretly courting, or you might need to spend a few hours in a temple to find the particular religious text that carries a seldom-used alternative name for a deity.

**Obscure Knowledge**: Obscure knowledge is known only to specialized sages and is typically of interest only to those scholars. As such, precious few tomes are written on obscure subjects. Finding the right expert to interview or the best book to read typically requires several days of research. Uncovering the details of a ritual used to open and close a portal to the Sea of Stars isn’t easy information to come by, but there are people out there who know how to do it  -  and who wrote the instructions down.

**Lost Knowledge**: Lost knowledge is so esoteric that even among a field’s most dedicated scholars, there might be only one or two individuals who have dug deep enough to know that lore. Lost knowledge could come from a time so long ago that only a single text in a dead language now holds the lore you seek. Such lore often takes more than a week to hunt down. The location of a legendary steel dwarf’s workshop is most likely lore that is lost - except for one map hidden in a private collection.

**Forbidden Knowledge**: Forbidden knowledge is lore that a powerful individual or organization is attempting to keep secret. Those who know the secrets speak of them in whispered codes after passwords are exchanged, and write texts using ciphers. Hunting down leads and making sense of them typically takes weeks. The location of the dagger that slit the throat of the god of death is hidden behind layers of encoded text, and written in a dead language known only to that god’s most devout followers.`})),re(oi,"goUndercover",r.createProject({id:"project-go-undercover",name:"Go Undercover",prerequisites:"Special",characteristic:[N.Intuition,N.Presence],goal:15,effect:`
Going undercover to spy on a group of people is a cheap and easy way to find what you’re looking for. Choose an organization when you undertake this activity. Completing this project grants you access to maps, knowledge about an organization’s operations, or some other piece of knowledge that would be considered common or obscure. At the Director’s discretion, you must have a disguise, signet ring, tattoo, or some other indication that you belong to the organization in order to begin this project. Additionally, the Director can decide that the knowledge you seek may not be gained through this project but rather through adventuring.

**Complications**: This project has its own special complications. The first time you complete this project within an organization, you have a 25% chance of being caught. Each time you complete this project with the same organization, the chance of you being caught the next time you use it within the same organization increases by 25% and the project goal increases by 30. If you are caught going undercover, you are ruthlessly pursued by the organization you were infiltrating.

While your secret is safe, you may be called upon by the organization to complete a task you may not want to do.

When you start a project with a master, you choose the goal you wish to work on as well as the benefit you would gain from it.

**Hone Ability**: You sharpen the potency of one of your abilities of your choice. Choose between adding a +1/+1/+1 damage bonus to the ability or improving the distance of a ranged ability by 2. An ability can only be honed this way once.

**Improve Control**: You’ve learned efficient use of one of your heroic abilities. Reduce its initial heroic resource cost by 1 (to a minimum of 1). An ability can only receive this benefit once.

**Acquire Ability**: If your master’s class is different than yours, they give you a taste of another way. You gain one Signature Ability from the master’s class.

Or it could be that they are a naturally inquisitive person who just wants to understand all they can about the timescape.";case Xt.Freedom:return"An NPC with the freedom motivation wants no authority above them and desires no authority over others.
