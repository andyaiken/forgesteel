# Issues with default MCDM PDF
Order of awkwardness when trying to make a character sheet automatically
## Important
- Missing skills for Carpentry and Cooking
- No spot for a heroic triggered action (an issue because the heroic slots don't
  include a "trigger" spot, and the supplied triggered ability slot is already
  used for another ability)
- Some effects on power rolls are so long they won't fit inside the power roll
  box
- "Ancestry" has 2 text boxes attached (causing an issue when trying to assign
  text to just one of the text boxes)

## Less important
- Modifiers assumes there's only one modifier, there's 2 on an elementalist
- Various form fields have inconsistent/misspelled names
- Indexing in names for Victory fields is out of order
