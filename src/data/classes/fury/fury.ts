You do not temper the heat of battle within you. You unleash it!

Let others use finesse to clean up the wreckage left in your wake.

As a fury, you devastate foes with overwhelming might, hurl yourself and enemies around the battlefield, and grow stronger as your ferocity increases. Nature has no concept of fairness — and neither do you..`,
