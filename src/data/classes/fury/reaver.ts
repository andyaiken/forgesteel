You are never surprised. Additionally, whenever you would push a target with forced movement, you can slide them instead.

As your ferocity grows, you gain benefits as noted on the Reaver Growing Ferocity table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved benefit replaces a lesser benefit.

* **Ferocity 2**: Whenever you use the Knockback maneuver, the forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Agility score.
* **Ferocity 4**: The first time you slide a creature on a turn, you gain 1 surge.
* **Ferocity 6**: You gain an edge on Agility tests and the Knockback maneuver.`
