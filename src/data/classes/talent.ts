	description: `
The talent is a master of psionics—a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. A talent can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature’s mind. In rare occurrences, people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, an event that activates a talent’s abilities, can actually tap into the mind’s full strength.

A talent is limited only by the strength of their mind. Powerful psionic heroes can have multiple active powers at once and change reality at will. But with this limitless potential comes a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming the talent, and those who use too many too quickly die from the exertion.`,
