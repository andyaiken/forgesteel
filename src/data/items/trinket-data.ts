The Gravekeeper’s Lantern can temporarily trap a nonhostile spirit of the dead—either an incorporeal undead or the wandering spirit of a creature who died within the last 30 days—allowing you to interrogate them. Trapping a spirit requires you to be within 10 squares of them and succeed on a hard Intuition test as a main action. Once a spirit is trapped, you make a Presence test to coax them into answering your questions:

| Roll    | Effect                                                                                     |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 11    | You can ask two questions of the spirit, one of which they must answer fully and honestly. |
| 12 - 16 | ou can ask three questions, two of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.        |
| ≥ 17    | You can ask five questions, all of which the spirit must answer fully and honestly.        |

A trapped spirit remains in the lantern for 10 minutes. They remember being trapped by you, and might become hostile thereafter.`
