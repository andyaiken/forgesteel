The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal—to live. 

Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to become monsters. A hero wouldn’t mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves—but they’ll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.`,
