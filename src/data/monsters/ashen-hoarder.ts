When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer’s door.`

That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle—usually a ring or an amulet—that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder’s remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in Draw Steel: Heroes and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.'
