Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct’s grim work. Articulated arms with attached tools and weapons aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.
  
When an ashen hoarder obtains a corpse, the construct impales it on one of the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with necrotic energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer’s door.`

It’s an agonizing process for the victim and freeing them is no easy task. Destroying the Soul Shackle is enough to send an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage, as it can feel part of its soul shredded into oblivion. It will kill any living creature it can before collapsing in on itself. Freeing the soul trapped inside requires a long-term project and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.'
