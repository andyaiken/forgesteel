Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to raise and train as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone as the basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas, largely due to their own limited options for companionship, commonly keep basilisks as pets. Both parties benefit from this symbiotic relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.`

Alchemists have discovered that after a basilisk eats petrified flesh, the basilisk’s gullet produces an oil that can be used to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

**ALCHEMICAL INGREDIENTS**
After a basilisk dies, a creature can make a medium Reason test on the basilisk’s gullet. On a success, the creature creates 3 doses of salve. One dose of salve can be applied to a petrified creature as an action, and 1 minute after the salve is applied, the petrified condition ends for that creature.

On a success with a consequence, you produce 1 dose of salve but cannot extract more from the spent gullet without completing a Find A Cure project. On a failure with a consequence, you can only rely on completing a Find A Cure project to extract enough salve from the gullet.`
