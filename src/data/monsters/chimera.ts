The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian—one with a dragon’s cunning, a lion’s bravery, and a ram’s tenacity. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector not just for herself but also her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the beast. As a conquering force swept into the land, slaughtering the chimera was their fell goal.

The queen’s resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras destroyed the opposing army, then dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.`
