	description: `
After falling to a vampiric curse in his early twenties, Count Rhodar—the last Lord of Glauer—ruled his tiny, heavily forested mountainous county in eastern Rhöl for three hundred years. There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.

Each new moon, when the Red Tax came due, the count would visit a young candidate, then emerge with renewed vitality. Across the land, folk feared their Dragon Count, but the witches of the wood wove a prophecy: “The land’s darkest hour shall be the redemption of House von Glauer.”

Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar—not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.

Under new rule, Rhodar’s people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches’ whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny.`,

“In those days the Chain was in service to the Emperor Gaius VIII, third of the Five Crusading Emperors, and 27th Emperor of Caelia. Gaius continued the crusades started by his illustrious granduncle. Those were profitable days for the Chain, the Wheel, and the Gate. While the other Helltroopers waded into the deserts of Khoursir and Khemhara, we battled in the forests of Vaslor. We had it easy. I hate deserts.

“Thinking his vampiric power would save him, Count Rhodar von Glauer waited until he was fulsome in his strength before trying to extend his dark realm into Caelian territory. But we know how to deal with vampires. The black and gold standard of the von Glauer family reads, “I do the devil’s work.” We can attest to that. We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, “He is the land!” but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds. Finger had to drop it in one of his bottomless sacks to stop the mists from coming. What the emperor will do with it, I don’t know. I fear that staff may hold more than the power to make the mist.”

			description: `
In spite of the fact that he literally preyed upon them (though only one a month!) the people of Glauer seemed to take great pride in their immortal count. Many historical sources record Von Glauer’s noble bearing. He took his role as protector and defender of the people and their well-being seriously, in keeping with the traditions of classical nobility. Invited guests must be treated with decency, insults demand apology or satisfaction. Debts must be repaid, treaties honored.

Those who violated the law or threatened his people met a very different Count. It was said he stalked his enemies in the guise of a great wolf, or wingéd gangrenous beast.

In his humanoid form he treated guests, even enemy commanders with honor and dignity. What his demeanor might be should he return is unknown.`

It’s been over a thousand years since The Chain of Acheron staked Von Glauer, but the wise women of Rhöl speak as though the Dragon Count is merely on vacation. Ajax killed the Earl of Rhöl during his conquest of Vasloria but has yet to dispatch anyone to rule in their stead.

For people of Glauer, the wise women’s prophesy feels close. They sense the import of the times in which they live, and expect Ajax or one of his lieutenants to return to rule with an iron fist. The people speak openly now of their Dragon Count returning to defend them against this possibility.

How his return might be possible is not clear, but it would surely involve the Rod of Count Rhodar Von Glauer, currently held under the city of Capital in the Great Reliquary of the Last Emperor, also known as Ringwell.`
