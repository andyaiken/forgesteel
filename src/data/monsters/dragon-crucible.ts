	description: `
Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief, born from failure in the pursuit of perfection. A dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate.

These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on fastidiously they are about cleaning, and occasionally gilded with more precious metals. When threatened, they can encase themselves in shields they have embedded subcutaneously beneath their scales. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.`,

Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in those cut with thick veins of iron. Occasionally they will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle the first thing in place is their colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, expressing their dragonseal by slagging it in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but they keep a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers. 

Eventually their entire lair is coated with hardened metal and discarded weapons, armor, and shields. This makes the lair of any crucible dragon hazardous to navigate, and extremely conductive of electricity.`

			description: `
The dragons tend to be obsessive collectors. They have a habit of hyper focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, The Rain of 10,000 Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Valsoria. Joris’nyrathi, The Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge.

Obsession aside, crucible dragons do manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than melting them down for filigree and embossment on the weapons and armor they forge. Adventurers plundering a crucible dragon’s hoard may not find much wealth but will usually find enough materials and armaments to supply several wars simultaneously.`

They will endlessly attempt to reproduce the perfect treasures they find among their most prized possessions but can only recreate flawed copies at a fraction of their original power. Discarded projects, melted heaps of raw iron, and scrap angrily embedded in the walls perpetually surround crucible dragons as examples of their failures, perpetuating a cycle of obsessive rage, grief, and inescapable decline.'

There is nothing a crucible dragon hates more than creativity, beauty, and exquisite craft. When raiding with a particular object in mind, they are not acute in how they make their entrance. Collateral damage is part of the equation and the message. Along with whatever they take, they’ll endeavor to destroy any great works of art, beautiful architecture, and slay craftspeople and artists who are considered the pinnacle of their craft within the immediate proximity.

The most notorious of these attacks was made by Nuvithiabalca the Hammer of the Spiteforge, who destroyed a dwarven Forgetemple at its grand opening. To add insult to injury, she killed the Forgetemple’s priesthood and its architect and absconded with the temples sacred Sainthammer before the stunned and horrified congregants could flee the grounds.`
