	description: `
Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief—often the result of failure in the pursuit of perfection. Each dragon is a dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate.

These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on how fastidious they are about cleaning, and are occasionally gilded with more-precious metals. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.`,

			description: 'Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in peaks cut through with thick veins of iron ore. Occasionally, one will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle, the first thing a crucible dragon sets in place is a colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, slagging that iron in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but a dragon keeps a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers.'

Crucible dragons are obsessive collectors, and have a habit of narrowly focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, the Rain of Ten Thousand Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Vasloria. Joris’nyrathi, the Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge.

All crucible dragons manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than for melting down as filigree or embossing the weapons and armor they forge.`
