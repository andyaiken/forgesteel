While many dragons command grand enclosed spaces, gloom dragons make their lair within sprawling, murky wilds, commanding vast territories. As clever as ravens and as cunning as hunting beasts, they use mimicry and hallucinations to draw unsuspecting travelers further and further into the mists of their domain, until the fog swallows the sound of their prey’s screams. 

Where gloom dragons settle, people are known to have more nightmares than usual. `

Gloom dragons are eerie collectors of voices, memories, nightmares, and items. As they can only repeat exactly what they’ve heard, they prize their vast collections of voices, tongues, and phrases, using these sounds to lure in mortals so they might draw out their memories and fears. Endlessly curious and fascinated by terror, they are keen to see what hallucinations terrorize their prey before they slaughter them. 

When they have slain their foe, they take not just whatever is valuable from their person, but also whatever is *meaningful* to their fears. A broken mirror from a dead lover will always fascinate a gloom dragon more than a perfect ruby brooch.`

Instinct and curiosity drive these enshrouded hunters. It is rare to find one that can be reasoned with, but some may develop an understanding with a nearby town, each leaving the other to their business. Since gloom dragons focus on individual terrorizing over mass destruction, it is easier to coexist with one lurking in the swamps nearby—but then these dragons become myths and stories told to children, ensuring they never follow voices into the fog.

When such an understanding is not reached, gloom dragons are feared for their command over illusions, darkness, and trickery. They have been known to torment entire regions, and as their knowledge grows, they only become more dangerous.`
