	description: ` Thorn dragons take root in the destitution of nature, and are cultivated by the suffering of those who struggle against the cruelty of drought, fire, flood, and more. Though a region’s people might have long overcome past famine, the desperation of those who suffered long before has already nurtured their future scourge.

These dragons appear born of the wood, resembling living thickets bedecked in torturous thorns. With twisting briar horns and wings shaped by tangled roots, thorn dragons embody the richness of nature they so readily leech the life from.`,

Thorn dragons cultivate their lairs in lush farmlands or flourishing forests. They engulf these beautiful regions in massive briar thickets, choking out existing flora until their own brambles are the only things that grow. In forests, this process drives out local fauna smart enough to flee rather than foolishly fight against the wood’s new ruler. When a thorn dragon establishes their lair over a village’s farmlands, local folk either wisely relocate or slowly starve for the sake of stubborn pride.`

Compared to more powerful dragons, thorn dragons are closer to beasts in temperament. They are incapable of speech and act primarily on instinct as they expand their territories, defend their lairs, and grow their hoards. 

Despite this, the folk of certain settlements manage to avoid being driven from their homes or starved at the expense of being dependent on a thorn dragon’s bestial ego. These farmers and woods folk come to a tenuous understanding with the dragon, trading them the kinds of treasure they desire in exchange for meager foodstuffs from the dragon’s hoard.`

When mere brambles aren’t enough, thorn dragons either imbue those brambles’ barbs with poison or breathe out those toxins directly, taking pleasure in slowly draining the life from their enemies.'
