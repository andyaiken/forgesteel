Though a region’s people may have long overcome past famine, the desperation of those who came before has already nurtured their future scourge. These dragons appear born of the wood, living thickets bedecked in torturous thorns. With twisting briar horns and wings shaped by tangled roots, thorn dragons embody the richness of nature they so readily constrict the life from.',

Thorn dragons cultivate their lairs in lush farmlands or flourishing forests. They overtake these beautiful regions with massive briar thickets, choking out the existing flora until the only thing that can grow are their own brambles. 

In forests, this ravaging drives out the local fauna smart enough to flee rather than foolishly fight against the wood’s new ruler. When a thorn dragon establishes their lair over a village’s farmlands, the populace either wisely flees or starves for their pride.`

Compared to more powerful dragons, thorn dragons are closer to beasts. They are incapable of speech and act primarily on instinct to expand their territory, defend their lair, and grow their hoard. 

Despite this, some villages manage to avoid being driven from their homes or starved within them—at the expense of being dependent on a thorn dragon’s bestial ego. These villagers come to a tenuous understanding with the dragon, trading it the kinds of treasure it desires in exchange for meager foodstuffs from the dragon’s hoard.`

In order to defend their home, these dragons take advantage of the thicket—by dragonsealing intruders, pushing and pulling them across the briars and letting the thorns bleed them dry. When the brambles aren’t enough, thorn dragons either imbue the barbs with poison or breathe the toxins directly, taking advantage of another way to slowly drain the life from their enemies.'
