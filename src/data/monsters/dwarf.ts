	description: `
Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarven flesh is infused with stone—a silico-organic hybrid making them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

They are the children of the elder god Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is “Ord made the world.” Their way of saying, “What will be, will be.” Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord’s name.`,

Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the Steel Dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power.

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it's a double headed hammer.  As much as they use it for destruction, construction is where they truly shine. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools created to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.`

			description: `
The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, their ancestors’ greatest achievement, but they’ve made great strides in researching them. They’ve innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator.

Operators now span the manifold and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for utility and construction purposes but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises.

Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where smiths, artisans, and craftspeople from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.`

Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kas Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept the order, and kept the city safe.

But now, the dwarves of Kas Kalavar have submitted to Ajax’s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need for bodies, either as forced labor or to be used to make war dogs and grant eternal life. Most dwarves do not like this deal, but the press gangs are committed to their work.

### Marauder Lord
A press gang’s marauder lord has in their possession a salvaged valok communication array, which they wear like a mohawk on their head. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including multiple axes in battle.`

Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with the stones. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle; often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to a crushing defeat.

Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers that harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today’s stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.`
