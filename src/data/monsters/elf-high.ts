The adage “knowledge is power” is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is “knowledge before power.” High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy.

In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.`

Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances.

Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.`

The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison.

Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.`
