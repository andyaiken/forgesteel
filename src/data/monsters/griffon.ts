	description: 'With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, the griffon hunts anything they desire—even other predators—though they prefer to eat birds, fish, and herd. Griffons sometimes misjudge their prey and attack humanoids passing through their mountain or forest territories. They also fiercely defend themselves against anyone who threatens or gets too close to their nests.',

			description: `
Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by griffon beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.`

			description: 'Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can’t fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly—and after that, it’s only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.'

			description: 'Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety and a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety. The latter only feeds on carrion, and experts continue to debate whether they should be considered a true griffon or if they deserve their own categorization. Rumors of a massive condor-tiger griffon have recently sprung up, and whether or not their existence is true, it has opened questions of whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands. Still, many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can return with evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.'
