Lizardfolk aren’t especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened—which it often is. Respectful travelers entering lizardfolk territory, however, find no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often focus on a specific trade, such as boat building, fletching, navigating, or weaving, and sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.

Adventurers often cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in abandoned ruins and caverns for protection. Treasure seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.`

			description: `
Lizardfolk prefer to fight in or near water whenever they can, and if they aren’t on a battlefield with water, they perform delaying actions to buy time while they flood the battlefield with their Malice features before attacking with full force. If water is already present, they focus on positioning in the early battle to surround and split up their opponents.

With a wide array of strong grab and forced movement abilities, lizardfolk tactics are that of divide and conquer, locking down strong defenders while abducting and isolating backline heroes. Lizardfolk also have strong teamwork features and rotate units who have lost their tails to more rear positions in favor of healthier units.

**Lizardfolk Sample Encounters**
- **Marsh Hunters, 18 EV**: Eight shellguard, eight tonguers, one scaletooth
- **Ambushers, 24 EV**: Sixteen grunts, two skyterrors
- **Scalesworn Detachment, 30 EV**: Eight shellguard, sixteen tonguers, one scaletooth, two bloodeyes
- **War Party, 48 EV**: Eight shellguard, eight grunts, eight tonguers, one scaletooth, one skyterror, one bloodeye, one deathrex`
