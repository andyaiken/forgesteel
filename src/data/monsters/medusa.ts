Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god—but while some medusas embrace wickedness, others simply fight for their lives against ignorant hunters.',

			name: 'Cursed for Defiance',
			description: `
When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, the deity may curse them to live as a medusa. The offender’s skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.

The gods who use this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude—or to places haunted by creatures who don’t judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories. Many plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of victims who foolishly hunted or harmed them.`

			description: `
While the medusa’s stone gaze is legendary, they also can move, strike, and evade as swiftly as a snake, even briefly manifesting scaled wings to dart through the chaos. This enhanced dexterity makes them difficult to pin down.

They can fire beams from their eyes, allowing them to attack at range as necessary, but they’re deadly in melee, where they have the full advantage of their snakes and the enervating venom pulsing through each set of needlelike fangs.`

			description: 'Medusas have many means to defend themselves, even aside from their petrifying stare. They slow enemies down, weaken them, and—once their petrifying magic has rooted itself in their foes—temporarily charm and control their enemies. These reclusive beings are no stranger to being outnumbered and overwhelmed; all they have in their power to gain leverage over their opponents, they wield ruthlessly.'

		{
			id: 'medusa-info-4',
			name: 'Stone Gardens',
			description: 'Medusas often reside in stone gardens filled with statues of those who previously tried to slay them. This not only allows them to slip between their statues, hide, and then strike, it also allows them to command the battlefield of stone, shattering statues to harm others. Some may slowly unpetrify their victims, one limb at a time, to feed on them, creating grotesque mausoleums of the dead for unwitting adventurers to wander into.'

			description: 'The deity who inflicted a medusa’s curse can rarely be convinced to lift the punishment, usually by undertaking an impossible task in the god’s name or making a threat they can’t ignore. Some sages claim ancient rituals can undo a god’s curse, but these lost secrets are hidden by wrathful divine servants—and performing such a ritual would almost certainly entail great sacrifice.'
