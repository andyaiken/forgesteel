Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart’s desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.`

The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.'

Ogres originally descended from the cyclops, an old-world giant with a single eye whose kind still roam through remote canyons and valleys. These behemoths stand heads above the ogres and are twice as destructive once they’ve spotted their prey. But while their binocular cousins have gone on to become successful hunters and live for themselves, the cyclops is a scavenger hindered by their poor eyesight. Most cyclopses are eager to work for and defend powerful warlords or wealthy ogres, as long as they have easy access to food and shelter.

Rumor has it that a cyclops can emit a mile-long energy ray from their eye. However, focusing such power is nearly impossible when their vision is usually too irritated and clouded by dirt.`
