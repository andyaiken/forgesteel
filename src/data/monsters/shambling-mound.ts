	description: `
The lush ground squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. By the time you realize the ground is moving, it’s too late— the shambling mound has devoured you.

Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.`,

			description: `
A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of nearby hags or mages, especially evil ones or those utilizing green magic. Latent magic seeps into the surrounding land, coalescing into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must grow, and to grow they must feed—and thus they drag themself in search of a hunting ground.

It is believed these magical origins are what give shambling mounds their ability to produce poisons. These poisons range from region to region—for example, the toxins from a shambling mound along coastal beaches or swamps might appear milky white and smell sweet like manchineel trees, while shambling mounds found in rainforests might give off a heady, intoxicating sweet scent at night, luring victims in with beautiful pale blooms like angel’s trumpets and producing intense hallucinations for those unfortunate enough to become poisoned.

While more specific effects may vary, each shambling mound’s toxins typically have the same aim: enervate their foes, so that they might magically absorb that strength and vitality.`

			description: 'As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass. When they find a good place to lurk until a meal comes to them, the result is far more satisfying. After a mound engulfs their prey—be they animal or adventurer—the meal-to-be is sealed in a sack of interwoven vines and leaves. This vegetative hunter can then sap the strength of those within to feast or empower itself.'

			id: 'shambling-mound-info-3',
			name: 'Verdant Core and Expansive Sprawl',
			description: `
When fighting a shambling mound, most attention is drawn to the cavernous chamber that holds their consumed victims. However, the shambling mound protects a smaller magical core with a knot of vines, leaves, and other natural defenses. The mound can expose this core to free up their form and become deadlier, thus opening themselves up, in turn, for more harm.

One must also be wary of the area around a shambling mound—their vines reach out far, the full extent of their form hidden amongst other flora until they strike enemies from afar.`
