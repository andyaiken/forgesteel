A wolf howls and your bowels freeze. Terror overcomes you. Sweat makes your skin slick, your senses sharpened. The moon is high but you feel hot. You’re burning up. There’s blood in your mouth and a corpse at your feet. Where did that come from?! That animal … that thing that almost clawed you to death last week … was it a wolf ? Was it just a wolf ?

Werewolves are shapeshifters filled with a need to rend and tear. They used to be ordinary humans, elves, polders, and the like. But when their feral compulsion takes control, they change into abominable beastment and sometimes massive wolves.`,

The curse of the werewolf is actively sought out by terrible nobles and rulers looking to extend their power and instill fear into their people. They secure deals with devils who can tap into the Primordial Chaos and unleash their beast, usually in exchange for relinquishing their legacy after they pass.

Laypeople don’t have the luxury of a legacy, nor do they have councils that can help temper a werewolf. They know full well the horror of losing oneself to the beast, and take action to rout out the threat of a werewolf among them. Fear leaves people submissive to the demands of cursed kings, yet oppressive to their own accursed kin.`
