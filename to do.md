# Development Plans

### Heroes

(nothing)

### Library

* It should be possible to add custom keywords to abilities / custom weapon or armor types in kits
* It should be possible to create a homebrew class ability / monster individually
* Monster Builder:
  * Auto-create monsters

### Playbook

* Encounter Builder:
  * When an encounter has monsters with items, this should be noted in the encounter info (monster info and running encounter notes)
  * Encounters should pull in monsters, rather than storing monster / group IDs
  * Set number of squares for per-square terrain
  * Use encounter templates
  * Auto-create encounters
* Tactical Maps:
  * Switch map Z level
    * Show (blurred, translucent, no pointer events) levels below / above
  * Ability to destroy tile squares / wall sections
* Regional Maps

### Session

* Encounter
  * Ability to set 'used reaction' flag on heroes / monsters / minions
  * Monsters:
    * Ability to duplicate / delete monsters in a slot
  * Terrain:
    * Show number of squares on terrain encounter row
    * Show 'should be N squares' for terrain
    * Ability to add new terrain objects
* Tactical map
  * Show altitude on minis
  * Minis should not be allowed to walk through walls
  * Add terrain minis / overlays
  * Show distance between selected mini and hovered square

### Ideas

* Add a way to load / save data from a remote folder / OneDrive / Google Docs / iCloud
* Add guides for specific features
  * Heroes / hero state / PDF export
  * Monster building / genesplice
  * Encounter building / running
  * Map making / adding minis


## Classic Sheet

### Heroes

- Add ability to create standalone 'reference sheets' with selectable 'reference cards'
- (possibly solved along with above) Have ability to create handout sheets with items, followers, etc without being attached to a character
- Check hero features/abilities for certain keywords and ensure relevant reference cards get put into the character sheet?
- Add user-selectable color scheme
